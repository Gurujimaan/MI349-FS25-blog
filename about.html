            Hi, my name is Gurmaan Singh Sandhu, I'm a junior GameDev Major at MSU. I'm from India and I don't really know what more to be adding in this little section.
        </p>

        <p>
            My hobbies are listed below, so for now I'll just talk about myself more. I'm mostly an introvert but that doesn't mean I'm not very social, I was student moderator in my school, and i'm quite good at leadership, I'm also an actor myself so I can do quite a few things. I'm also thinking of leaning into music next semester onwards.
        </p>

        <h3>My base hobbies</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Video Games (I'm a game major duh)</li>
            <li>Manga</li>
            <li>Hiking</li>
            <li>Listening to music while walking around endlessly for hours</li>
        </ol>

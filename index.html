            <p>
                This will be my first devlog for my IndieCade Internship and Climate Jam. Noted as Week #0 since the jam begins at the end of this week.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’ve put in quite a few hours into the internship already, I attended the meetings this week, and introduced myself. This was then followed by the team building, and I posted my team-forming post and quite quickly got two team requests. Instead of joining either, I got the two teams to combine, and am now in a 14-member dev team. 
            </p>
            <p>We also had to complete our weekly assignments, including the Playsearch document, Climate Stories, as well as this Devlog itself. The reason all of these are typed pages is since I simply feel most comfortable doing that, though I may switch to YouTube videos for Devlogs once the jam kicks on.</p>

            <p>In terms of the work done in the team itself, I held a forward stance for getting work done fast, and put some leadership skills to use by getting a meeting decided, and getting a quick online whiteboard prepared with all our plans for the game, through categorization, including how the team is divided, the inspirations we wish to take, a basic start on mechanics, and how we wish to use and interpret the theme of “Natural and Unnatural Disasters.”</p>
            
            <p>I’m quite happy with the progress we’ve made already.</p>

            <h3>A Portal Review</h3>
            <p><small>Published on <time datetime="2025-09-23">September 23, 2025</time> | Author: Gurmaan Singh Sandhu </small></p>
            <img src="portal.jpg" alt="portal game img">
            <p>
                I played Portal for about two hours in one sitting, and these are my impressions of the game. In that time, I made it through the first eighteen test chambers and stopped at that point. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Most of my time was spent solving puzzles that were teaching me how the portal gun works, starting with the simpler line-of-sight mechanics with lasers and boxes and buttons, and then eventually moving into levels involving flinging myself across gaps, dodging turret fire, and timing platforms. 
            </p>
            <p>Along the way, Glados gave me instructions, tips and some sarcastic comments, which slowly shifted from sounding neutral and helpful to more threatening, and while I have not played Portal before, I have played it’s sequel and really liked how they showed the slow reveal of Glados. I also must add that the humor really lightened the mood of the more serious design and art style the game went for. By the end of Chamber 18, I could tell the story was building up to a boss battle with Glados but never got to it, though I assume it might’ve been chamber 20 or 25.</p>

            <p>
                Portal obviously falls under the puzzle game genre, seen through an fps perspective. The wierd blend of puzzle-shooter design is one of the reasons Portal stands out so much. It expands the puzzle genre by showing that problem-solving doesn’t have to be a top-down or 2D experience, and not every puzzle game needs to be a sokkabon. The use of physics from half-life really diferenitate it from other games, especially for it’s time.
            </p>

            <p>
                And most obviously, the thing that makes portal stands out, are the portals themselves. It popularised portals so much, since before it, portals were pretty much just used in games as a way to fast-travel or teleport. If you’ve every heard of splitgate, it’s an entire fps 5v5 shooter with it’s main mechanic and USP being that the players can use portals in fights (which just so happen to be coloured blue and orange).
